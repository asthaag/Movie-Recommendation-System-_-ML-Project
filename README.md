# Movie-Recommendation-System-_-ML-Project

The Movie Recommendation System is a content-based recommender implemented using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. This system leverages the power of text vectorization and cosine similarity to suggest movies similar to a user's favorite. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and key features like genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director are selected and pre-processed to handle missing values. These features are then combined into a single text string for each movie. Using TfidfVectorizer, the text data is converted into numerical feature vectors, which are subsequently used to compute similarity scores between movies via cosine similarity. The system prompts the user to input their favorite movie, finds the closest match from the dataset using difflib, and retrieves a list of movies ranked by their similarity scores. Finally, it displays the top 30 recommended movies. This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning techniques to create a user-friendly recommendation system, emphasizing data preprocessing, feature extraction, and similarity computation.
